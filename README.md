## Installation

Ready to dive in? Let's get you set up!

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.11**
- **uv**

### Through PyPI

Simply run `pip install opsbox` to install the minimal set of opsbox tools.

If using UV, run `uv add opsbox`

*Note: If you want to install AWS plugins, use the aws extras group, `opsbox[aws]`*

### Through Github

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sudoersllc/Opsbox.git
    cd Opsbox
    ```

2. **Install with uv**

    We use [`uv`] for managing dependencies. If you don't have it installed, you can get it via pip:

    ```bash
    pip install uv
    ```

    Now, let's install Opsbox:

    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

    This command will install all required dependencies specified in `pyproject.toml`.

### Using Rego Plugins
Open Policy Agent (OPA) is an open-source policy engine that enables organizations to implement policy as code across diverse environments. Its policy language, Rego, allows users to define rules that dictate system and application behavior.

We use rego code to gather details about connected systems, alongside an Open Policy Agent (OPA) server, then format it for consumption by a language model.

#### Create a OPA Policy docker image
To run OpsBox with rego plugins, you'll need an OPA server. This is because OpsBox uses OPA to enforce policies on all resources that are being managed.

if you don't have OPA installed on your machine, or you dont have a running OPA instance, you can create a docker image for OPA.

Start by [installing docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

Create a dockerfile and add the following code:
```docker
    # Use the official OPA image
    FROM openpolicyagent/opa:latest

    # Expose OPA's default port
    EXPOSE 8181

    # Run OPA with the specified policy file
    CMD ["run", "--server", "--addr", "0.0.0.0:8181"]
```

Navigate to the directory and Build the Docker image:
```bash
    docker build -t name_of_file .
```
or you can also follow the offical OPA documentation to create the engine: [OPA Documentation](https://www.openpolicyagent.org/docs/latest/)

## Running Opsbox

Time to see the magic in action!

Simply run:

```bash
uv run opsbox ...
```

or, if not using UV:

```bash
python -m opsbox ...
```

This will launch Opsbox and display the CLI help along with available commands.

### Example Usage

Want to run a specific pipeline? Here's how:

```bash
uv run opsbox --modules your_input-your_optional_assistant-your_output --opa_upload_url http://your-opa-upload-url --opa_apply_url http://your-opa-apply-url
```

or, if not using UV:

```bash
python -m opsbox --modules your_input-your_optional_assistant-your_output --opa_upload_url http://your-opa-upload-url --opa_apply_url http://your-opa-apply-url
```

## Configuration

Opsbox is flexible when it comes to configuration. You can provide options via:

- **Command-Line Arguments**
- **Configuration Files**
- **Environment Variables**

### Using a Configuration File

Create a file named `.opsbox_conf.json` in your home directory:

```json
{
  "aws_access_key_id": "YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID",
  "aws_secret_access_key": "YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY",
  "aws_region": "YOUR_AWS_REGION",
  "opa_upload_url": "http://your-opa-upload-url",
  "opa_apply_url": "http://your-opa-apply-url"
}
```

### Command-Line Arguments

You can also provide configuration options directly through the command line:

```bash
python -m opsbox --modules example_module --aws_access_key_id YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_ID --aws_secret_access_key YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY --aws_region YOUR_AWS_REGION --opa_upload_url http://your-opa-upload-url --opa_apply_url http://your-opa-apply-url
```

## Plugins
You'll probably want some plugins to get started!

Opsbox plugins published by gsudoers normally take the format of `opsbox-<name>-<plugin_type>`, and are accessible and searchable through PyPI.

There's also a collection of plugins available for AWS systems, installable by using the pip extras group `aws`:

```pip install 'opsbox[aws]'```


## Let's Get Started!

Now that you're all set, it's time to unleash the power of AI on your infrastructure. Happy automating!
